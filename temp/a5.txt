Firearms are great self
defense tools, but the
number of idiots walking
around who have never
been trained on using
them is terrifying. Go
to a range and
try to hit a
target with a hand
gun. Not so easy
is it? Now imagine
there's a person threatening
your family, it's dark,
and you're half asleep.
Now you understand why
guns are very dangerous
in untrained hands. That
sales guy at your
local store should have
insisted you also sign
up for a course.
