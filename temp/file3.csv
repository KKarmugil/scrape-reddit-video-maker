Like in my State, I might have a ""responsibility to egress"" which means I have to make every reasonable attempt to flee, and only kill in Self-Defense if that is not reasonably possible to egress. In the State next door, they might have ""Stand your ground"" where there is no need to ever flee, you are allowed to defend yourself right where you currently stand. Other States might have Castle Doctrine, others might not. Etc.

Also, if you defend yourself with a firearm, expect that firearm to be gone for years and years, sitting in an evidence locker during trial and sometimes for a long time after. Basically consider that firearm ""gone"" for the foreseeable future. Many people expect all their property returned to them immediately... but that's now how it works.","Firearms are great self defense tools, but the number of idiots walking around who have never been trained on using them is terrifying.

She got dinged by a hit-and-run driver on the way to the date.  Not horrific, but she needed stitches in her leg.  Fortunately, a fire fighter happened to be walking past and helped her out of the road, did First Aid.  

So she was super-late but still showed up at my place.  I took her to the ER.  We waited for like four hours before they took her away to do medicine.

I waited another three hours.  The receptionist couldn't legally tell me what was up with my date.  Right, right -- I'm not a relative or an emergency contact or anything.

Waited a couple more hours.  Gave up and went home.  Turned out she'd left the hospital about an hour after the doctor saw her; the nurse thought I'd left and told her I was gone.  So she took a taxi home, took painkillers, fell asleep.

I called her the next day to make sure she was OK and find out what happened.  Turned out, no hard feelings, but she already had a date with the fire fighter who was there when she got hit.
