Self-defense stops when the
attacker is down/out. IE
if you shoot a
person threatening you with
a gun and then
proceed to "double tap"
them when they're down
you'll lose the self-defense
aspect and move towards
assault territory. Same thing
happens with a fist
fight; if I put
you down on the
ground I can't come
over and just start
kicking the shit out
of you since the
initial threat has been
neutralized.
