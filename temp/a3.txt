I think a lot
of people over estimate
“I’ll just punch em
in the face” as
a means of thinking
they’d be good. Frankly
you’ll probably not be
able to land a
square punch and honestly,
even if you do,
you’re probably not going
to do as much
damage as you think.
Like the one-shot-knock-out-blow probably
isn’t in the cards
for an untrained person.
