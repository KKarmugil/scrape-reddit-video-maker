"Self Defense" isn't a
pure law that covers
all, and different areas
of different rules/laws around
it. Like in my
State, I might have
a "responsibility to egress"
which means I have
to make every reasonable
attempt to flee, and
only kill in Self-Defense
if that is not
reasonably possible to egress.
In the State next
door, they might have
"Stand your ground" where
there is no need
to ever flee, you
are allowed to defend
yourself right where you
currently stand. Other States
might have Castle Doctrine,
others might not. Etc.
Also, if you defend
yourself with a firearm,
expect that firearm to
be gone for years
and years, sitting in
an evidence locker during
trial and sometimes for
a long time after.
Basically consider that firearm
"gone" for the foreseeable
future. Many people expect
all their property returned
to them immediately... but
that's now how it
works.
